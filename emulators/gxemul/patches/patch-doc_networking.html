+<h3>Virtual Ethernet switch using a <i>tap</i> device:</h3>
+
+<p>The simplest way to emulate a real Ethernet network is using a <i>tap</i>
+device.  In this mode, the emulator disables the simulated NAT and
+direct-access machinery and internally treats all emulated NICs as if
+they are on a single Ethernet switch.  In this mode, packets destined for
+the guest's specific MAC address as well as Ethernet multicast and broadcast
+packets are send to the individual guest instances.  Individual NIC
+emulations may also apply their own multicast filtering; multcast filtering
+is implemented for the DEC 21143 and Lance NICs.
+
+<p>The <i>tap</i> interface on the host can be thought of as an upstream
+link on the virtual Ethernet switch.  In addition to providing a "port"
+for the host, the <i>tap</i> interface can be bridged to a physical Ethernet
+port on the host, allowing the guests to access the host's connected LAN.
+
+<p>Networking services such as DHCP and DNS must be provided either by
+the host or by the host's connected LAN.
+
+<p>Support for the <i>tap</i> device was developed on NetBSD, but should
+also work on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux hosts.
+
+<p>Here is a simple example:
+
+<p><pre>
+<font color="#2020cf">!  Configuration file for
+!  virtual Ethernet switch networking
+!  using a tap device.</font>
+
+<b>net(</b>
+	<b>tapdev(</b><font color="#ff003f">"/dev/tap0"</font><b>)</b>
+<b>)</b>
+<b>machine(</b>
+	<b>name(<font color="#ff003f">"guest machine"</font>)</b>
+
+	<b>type(<font color="#ff003f">"dec"</font>)</b>
+	<b>subtype(<font color="#ff003f">"5000/200"</font>)</b>
+
+	<font color="#2020cf">!  Add a disk, etc.</font>
+<b>)</b>
+</pre>
+
+<p>Before starting the emulator, you will need to create the <i>tap</i>
+interface on the host.  Here is an example for NetBSD:
+
+<p><pre>
+<b>#ifconfig tap0 create up</b>
+</pre>
+
+<p>If you wish to simply network the host and the guests together, then
+simply assign an IP address to the <i>tap</i> interface on the host:
+
+<p><pre>
+<b># ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.254</b>
+</pre>
+
+<p>You can now run a DHCP server on the host for the guests, or you can
+configure the guests manually.
+
+<p>If instead you would like to bridge to the host's connected LAN,
+Here is an example for NetBSD:
+
+<p><pre>
+<b># ifconfig bridge0 create up</b>
+<b># brconfig add tap0 add wm0</b>
+</pre>
+
+<p>Although it <i>is</i> possible to have more than one machine per 
+configuration file, I strongly recommend against it. Please use one 
+configuration file for one emulated machine.  Each configuration file
+must have a unique <i>tap</i> instance, and machines in separate
+configuration files must use bridged <i>tap</i> devices if they wish
+to communicate with each other as if on the same LAN.
