+ Build works on NetBSD
- Build needs testing on illumos
- Build needs testing on other OSes
- Server functionality needs testing

Non-essential:

- mroonga fails to build on NetBSD (on illumos too, apparently)
- tokudb fails to build on NetBSD (this was disabled in older packages, too)
- dtrace fails to build
